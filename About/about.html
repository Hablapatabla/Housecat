  <p style="font-size: 60px; text-align: center;">CAT FACTS</p>
  <p>We are a collection of upperclassmen at Tufts University, studying a variety of subjects from Computer Science to Film. From our birth in September 2018, we have been playing, writing, and performing together, always looking
  for a new way to channel our artistic energy.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A band seven-strong, we leverage our numbers and textures to help guide ourselves, and our audiences, on journeys
  through sound. Constantly experimenting, improvising, and refining, every performance is unique and a singular experience. Our band has been on the cover of flagship music newpapers like only Melisma soon hopefully. We bring these things to every tune we write and every venue we play: </p>
  <br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Pocket so deep you forget what you are</li>
    <li>Harmony so melodious you forget who you are</li>
    <li>Melody so harmonious you forget where you are</li>
    <li>Jazz</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We hope to see you all in person and hope to make you feel how we do. Happy. Elated. Euphoric. Orgasmic. Housecat.
  </p>
